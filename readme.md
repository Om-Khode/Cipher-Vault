## Acknowledgments

This project is developed with insights from the book **"TypeScript Quickly"** by Yakov Fain and Anton Moiseev. The book has been an invaluable resource in understanding TypeScript's features and best practices, contributing to the robustness and clarity of our codebase.

I express our gratitude to the authors for sharing their knowledge and making a significant impact on my development journey.
